    <h3>Project Overview:-</h3>
    This Amazon clone was my first project, created with the guidance of Apna
    College tutorials by Shradha Khapra. Building this project strengthened my
    understanding of HTML and CSS, and introduced me to essential web
    development concepts.

    <h3>Skills & Concepts Learned:-</h3>
    Through this project, I sharpened my foundational skills, learned new
    styling techniques, and improved my ability to structure web pages. The
    tutorial also provided various exercises, which gave me more hands-on
    experience and boosted my coding confidence.

    <h3>My Coding Journey:-</h3>
    Working on this project reminded me of how learning to code is like a baby
    learning to take first steps — it’s about starting small and building up
    gradually. Tackling simple programs and exercises helped me grasp the
    fundamentals and gave me a solid base to build on. I realized that mastering
    these basics is the key to a strong foundation in coding.
